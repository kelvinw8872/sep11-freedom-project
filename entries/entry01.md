# Entry 1

When thinking about a website to make, I have been considering many topics. When I was a very little boy, I always wanted to be an astronaut kid! I've really enjoyed shows about people in space growing up. Learning more about astronauts, I noticed that they all had rocket ships! Discovering this, opened my interest on how amazing rockets worked and the science behind it. Reminiscing about them days really helped me decide on my final topic.

I can get a basic understanding of rocket science through NASA. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an agency working for the United States federal government responsible for many space programs and research. Luckily for me, NASA has a website with tons of useful and reliable information on rockets.(https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-rocket-k4.html)

Doing all this research will help me gather an understanding on how rockets work, and possibly motivate others to innovate their own rockets which can help us discover a new home since our Earth is struggling due to all the climate change.

Outside of my project, I have devoloped skills such as, how to google and embracing failure. Originally, I wanted to work on marine biology, however I struggled to learn and discover a problem behind it. Bebracing this failure, I found a new topic which I am very passionate about! Googling information is a very important skill to me. Being able to access reliable information in seconds really helps me in my everyday life and with this project. 

All in all, I have a lot about rocket science that I have to learn about such as the programming and code used to make the rockets work. It believe it will be a very interesting process, conveying my research throught my blog entries.
